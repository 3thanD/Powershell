This command finds users with a specific UPN then replaces them with the new UPN you set up in ADDS: 
$LocalUsers = Get-ADUser -Filter {UserPrincipalName -like '*UPN to be Replaced'} -SearchBase "Distinguished Name of OU in Active Directory" -Properties UserPrincipalName -ResultSetSize $null

$LocalUsers | foreach {$newUpn = $_.UserPrincipalName.Replace("Old UPN","New UPN"); $_ | Set-ADUser -UserPrincipalName $newUpn}

Once completed use this Test command to verify the changes were made: 
Get-ADUser -Filter {UserPrincipalName -like '*Any UPN'} -SearchBase "Distinguished name of where you are searching" | Format-Table Name, UserPrincipalName
